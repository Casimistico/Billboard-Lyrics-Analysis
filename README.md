Analysis of Top 50 Billboard songs since 1964 up to 2015 


This is my first proyect on github,where Top 50 Billboard,from 1964 up to 2015, are analyzed using Pandas and Nltk packages. 
Different parts of speech (verbs, adjetives, adverbs) are also obtained and its evolution through different years are observed graphically.   
Word frequencies through dedades is also calculated and ploted using Word Clouds; some specific words that appeared in last decades are ploted. 

In order to analyze parts of speech nltk package comes with helpful tools. In order to use them first you must download them using:

nltk.download() 

This should be run only once; for  more information visit: https://www.nltk.org/data.html
